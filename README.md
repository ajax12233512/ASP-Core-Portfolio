# ASP.NET CORE PORTFOLIO

[Deployed Link](https://neilazureportfolio.azurewebsites.net/)

# Description
This .net application is my first attempt at building a personalzed portfolio using the tools and resources provided by Microsoft and Visual Studio. 
My intention in building this app is to familiarize myself with the c# enviornment and to learn different ways of web programming aside from javascript frameworks. Being a react developer, I am very used to component driven UI's, and I have learned a lot of different techniques through completing this personal project. 

# Technologies
1. ASP.NET Core
2. p5.js
